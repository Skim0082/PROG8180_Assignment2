# PROG8180_Assignment2
Web Technologies - Assignment 2

Please use GIT and submit a link to your github repositories for each part of the assignment!  Please have well documented commit messages so I can see the history of your work.

1. Write a solution for the pizzeria problem from Assignment #1 using MVC and Object Oriented PHP. You may use CakePHP if you like. Keep track of Sessions as necessary and save each order to a MySQL Database.
Allow Pizzeria employees to login to an "admin" section to view current and past orders. They must also be able to mark orders as "complete" (and therefore moving the order from current to past). They may also be able to edit orders or delete orders.
Please write your database scheme as a single SQL file.

2. In Lab, we built a simple javascript system to switch the image shown by clicking on a thumbnail (See Lab4 on my github if you missed it!). Use this concept to build the game of Concentration, where cards are randomly laid out face down, and two cards are flipped over at each turn. The object of the game is to find all the matching cards (leave them flipped over once found to be a match!).
The cards can be any image you choose, and the design is completely up to you!
You may use Bootstrap for styles, but not Javascript.
You may use jQuery for javascript.
The user experience should be consistent, no matter the screen size!
